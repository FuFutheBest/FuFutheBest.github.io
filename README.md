## üõ†Ô∏è About the Site

This blog is built using **GitHub Pages**, which allows me to publish content directly from a GitHub repository without needing a separate hosting service.

The site is based on the [Academic Pages](https://academicpages.github.io/) Jekyll template, which provides a clean and flexible design for academic and personal websites. You can find the original documentation and credits in the `references` folder of this repository.
